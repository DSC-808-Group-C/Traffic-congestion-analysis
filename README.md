# **Predictive Modeling of Traffic Congestion in Lagos, Nigeria**  
### *A Machine Learning Approach*  

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores traffic congestion in **Lagos, Nigeria**, using **machine learning** techniques to analyze and predict congestion levels. Given Lagos' status as Africa’s economic hub with a rapidly growing population, traffic congestion remains a critical issue. Our study aims to provide **data-driven insights** to improve urban mobility and transportation infrastructure.  

## **Objectives**  
🔹 **Forecast traffic congestion levels** based on **spatiotemporal** and **environmental** factors.  
🔹 Identify the **most influential factors** affecting traffic congestion.  
🔹 Provide **route recommendations** based on predicted congestion levels.  
🔹 Offer **data-driven insights** for urban planners to improve transportation infrastructure.  

## **Dataset & Data Collection**  
To conduct this study, we scraped real-time traffic and weather data from **Google Maps** and **OpenWeather API** at 15-minute intervals over a 3-month period. The dataset focuses on major traffic hotspots in Lagos, Nigeria.  

## **Technology Stack**  
✅ **Programming Language:** Python  
✅ **APIs Used:** Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap  
✅ **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask (for API)  
✅ **Machine Learning Models:** Regression models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
